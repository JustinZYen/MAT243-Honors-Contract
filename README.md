1. Given the truth values of the propositions p and q, find the
truth values of the conjunction, disjunction, exclusive or,

2. Given two bit strings of length n, find the bitwise AND,
bitwise OR, and bitwise XOR of these strings.
3. Give a compound proposition, determine whether it is satisfiable by checking its truth value for all positive assignments of truth values to its propositional variables.
4. Given the truth values of the propositions p and q in
fuzzy logic, find the truth value of the disjunction and
the conjunction of p and q (see Exercises 46 and 47 of
Section 1.1).
5. Given positive integers m and n, interactively play the game
of Chomp.
6. Given a portion of a checkerboard, look for tilings of this
